3. **Follow Coding Standards**: Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Update Your Branch**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add appropriate comments
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test Your Changes**
   - Build the project successfully
   - Test all functionality thoroughly
   - Ensure no regressions are introduced

   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a pull request on GitHub.

### Pull Request Requirements

- **Clear Description**: Explain what the PR does and why
- **Link Issues**: Reference any related issues
- **Screenshots**: Include screenshots for UI changes
- **Testing**: Describe how you tested the changes
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

### Commit Message Convention

We follow conventional commit messages:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## üìù Coding Standards

### C++ Guidelines

- **Modern C++20**: Use modern C++ features appropriately
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `LibraryManager`)
  - Functions/Methods: `camelCase` (e.g., `getUserById`)
  - Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `currentUser`)
  - Member variables: `m_` prefix (e.g., `m_userId`)
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_LOAN_PERIOD`)

- **Code Style**:
  - Use 4 spaces for indentation
  - Maximum line length: 100 characters
  - Place opening braces on the same line
  - Use meaningful variable and function names

### Qt Guidelines

- **Signal/Slot Connections**: Use new-style syntax with function pointers
- **Memory Management**: Use smart pointers and RAII principles
- **UI Design**: Use Qt Designer for UI layouts
- **Internationalization**: Prepare strings for translation with `tr()`

### Documentation

- **Header Files**: Document all public interfaces
- **Complex Functions**: Add detailed comments for complex algorithms
- **Class Documentation**: Include class purpose and usage examples
- **README Updates**: Update documentation for new features

Example:
```cpp
/**
 * @brief Processes a book loan for a specific user
 * 
 * This function handles the complete loan process including:
 * - Availability checking
 * - User eligibility verification
 * - Due date calculation
 * - Database updates
 * 
 * @param userId The unique identifier of the borrowing user
 * @param resourceId The unique identifier of the resource to loan
 * @param loanPeriod Optional custom loan period in days
 * @return LoanResult containing success status and loan details
 * @throws LoanException if the loan cannot be processed
 */
LoanResult processLoan(const QString& userId, const QString& resourceId, int loanPeriod = -1);
```
